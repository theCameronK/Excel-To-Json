# Excel-To-Json

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These VBA scripts takes a table in excel and converts it to a .json document

The .json document will be name "data.json", but that can be changed in the code. It is saved to the same directory where the Excel workbook is saved, but that too can be changed in the code.

The script excelToJson checks how many columns there are and how many rows and goes through each cell in a row and converts it to the .json format.

It only works is the active sheet has one table starting in the A1 cell.
